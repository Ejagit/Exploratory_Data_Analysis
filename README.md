# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository
Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository! This repository houses a collection of detailed and insightful EDA projects focused on various datasets. Each project is designed to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, providing a deeper understanding of the datasets explored.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and transforming variables to make the data suitable for analysis.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics to provide a quick overview of the data.
- Data Visualization: Using various plots (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.) to visually explore the data and identify patterns or anomalies.
- Correlation Analysis: Investigating relationships between variables to understand how they interact with each other.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on existing data to enhance the predictive power of machine learning models.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have an EDA project you'd like to add, or if you want to improve existing analyses, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.
